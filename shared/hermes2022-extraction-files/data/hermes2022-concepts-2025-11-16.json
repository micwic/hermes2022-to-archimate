      "PHASE STRUCTURE: Extract phase hierarchy - 1=Initiation (project start), 2=Execution (solution development with 2.1=Concept, 2.2=Implementation, 2.3=Deployment), 3=Closure (project end). Explain how phases structure the project lifecycle",
      "SCENARIOS: Extract what scenarios are and their purpose - predefined configurations for different project situations, how they adapt HERMES to specific contexts",
      "MODULES: Extract what modules are - thematic groupings of tasks that organize work across scenarios, their role in structuring activities",
      "TASKS: Extract what tasks are - discrete work units executed within modules, how they relate to results and roles",
      "RESULTS: Extract what results are - deliverables produced by tasks, their role as project outcomes and decision points",
      "ROLES: Extract what roles are - responsibilities assigned to stakeholders, how they interact with tasks and results",
      "RELATIONSHIPS: Extract how these components interact - how scenarios combine modules, how modules group tasks, how tasks produce results and involve roles",
      "GOVERNANCE: Extract governance mechanisms - milestones, quality gates, release decisions, how HERMES ensures project control and quality assurance",
      "METHODOLOGY CHARACTERISTICS: Extract key features - modularity (adaptable configuration), uniformity (consistent interfaces), flexibility (traditional/agile support), scalability (different project sizes)",
      "TRADITIONAL APPROACH: Extract how HERMES supports traditional project management - sequential phases, comprehensive planning upfront, waterfall execution",
      "AGILE APPROACH: Extract how HERMES supports agile methods - iterative execution, incremental delivery, adaptive planning",
      "HYBRID APPROACH: Extract how HERMES accommodates hybrid methodologies - combining traditional and agile elements, flexibility in approach selection",
      "OUTCOME FOCUS: Extract HERMES emphasis on outcomes - deliverable-driven approach, results as success criteria, outcome-based project control",
      "ADAPTABILITY: Extract how HERMES adapts to different contexts - scenario selection, module configuration, task tailoring",
      "CONSISTENCY: Extract how HERMES ensures consistency - standard terminology, uniform phase structure, common interfaces between components",
      "Target length: 300-500 words (≈ 1800-3000 characters). Extract only information explicitly present on the two referenced pages",
      "Output: plain text (no Markdown formatting). Site language (English). Factual, neutral style, without extrapolation",
      "Construct a flowing narrative that integrates all extracted elements into a coherent overview of the methodology as a whole"
