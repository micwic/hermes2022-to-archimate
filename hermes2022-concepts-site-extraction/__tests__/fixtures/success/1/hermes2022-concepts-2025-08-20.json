    "overview": "HERMES2022 defines a structured, phase‑oriented life cycle for projects with clear and uniform interfaces between phases, decision points, and quality gates that enable governance, predictability, and transparency across traditional and agile delivery modes. The approach emphasises a consistent articulation from Initiation to Closure, with Execution acting as a composite umbrella that contains the Concept, Implementation, and Deployment sub‑phases. Each phase has distinct objectives, responsibilities, and deliverables, with traceability to project outcomes. In Initiation, the vision, scope, and feasibility are established to ensure that the endeavour is justified and aligned with strategic objectives. Execution provides a rigorous framework to refine solution concepts, realise the solution incrementally, and deploy it in a controlled, value‑centric manner. Concept establishes the solution approach and validates it against business needs and constraints. Implementation focuses on building the solution components, ensuring quality, compliance, and integration readiness. Deployment brings the solution to the operational environment with structured readiness checks, transition activities, and stakeholder enablement. Closure consolidates the achieved value, formalises acceptance, transfers operational responsibilities, and captures lessons learned to enrich organisational knowledge. The methodology maintains uniform interfaces so that stakeholders can navigate across phases consistently, regardless of delivery method, and creates decision checkpoints that ensure continued alignment with objectives. HERMES2022 thus supports both traditional and agile ways of working, encouraging iterative delivery and continuous learning while preserving governance discipline.",
